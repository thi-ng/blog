# Dashboard-driven decision making

This is a great point and very much translates to so many other parts of
life/work where people stop listening to their "body" (or to their
org/product/offering), outsourcing/numbing/dumbing down their decision making
based on dashboards of collected metrics and then changing their behaviors on
auto-pilot to improve said metrics — without ever asking themselves if the data
collected actually represents answers to the right (or even important)
questions...

Metrics always invite comparison & competition — on a global scale — often
without considering our own subjective contexts/needs/limits/aims...

Does the number of copilot prompts per day on a CTO dashboard indicate a highly
productive developer or does a big fat zero merely show a different approach to
problem solving?

Does the lack of constant updates to a FLOSS project mean it's become
neglected/unusable or does it simply indicate it reached a level of stability?

Likewise, does my product/app need constant UI changes/updates to "streamline"
user experience (often without even consulting users) based on some "goal"
metrics?

Am I seen as an unproductive FLOSS developer if my public commit log doesn't
show daily updates? Do gaps indicate laziness, illness, deep thinking or work on
other projects? Like gaps in a CV, will these gaps of activity data hinder
future employment chances or would I even want to work with orgs who select on
this criteria?

Is a hike only good/better because it exceeds X kilometers or Y elevation
meters? How does one measure the stunning views or the quality of the company
which shared that experience?
