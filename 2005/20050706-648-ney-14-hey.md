# 648 ney, 14 hey, 18 couldn't care less

While the entire office is celebrating London winning the 2012 Olympics, I think
this day already has had a more important & historic decision: [EU Parliament
rejects Patent
Law](http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&sid=a9_JRGCE0h6A&refer=home)
with a whopping 648:14 majority - quite simply amazing, and also quite
surprising, it made my day! Thanks to all the nice people at
[FFII](http://ffii.org/) et al...
