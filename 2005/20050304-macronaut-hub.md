# 1st public release of the macronaut hub

this is something which has been haunting me for quite a long while... this week
i finally managed putting together some documentation and a project site for the
successor of the original [macronaut demo](http://toxi.co.uk/macronaut/) from 2002.
today i released this little gem as standalone music visualizer as well as in
source form (under the CC license).

[the hub](http://toxi.co.uk/hub/) now consists of a custom engine to analyze the
sound input and a total of 11 new 3D visual modules which are all controlled by
the engine. the app is most probably my last project i've ever done with
[Director](http://macromedia.com/director), and of course wouldn't have been
possible without the fabulous [asFFT
Xtra](http://www.blogger.com/www.as-ci.net/asFFTXtra/) by Antoine Schmitt.

i hope you enjoy - it's friday after all...
