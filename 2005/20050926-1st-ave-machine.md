# 1st Ave Machine

Usually I don't do link blogging, but there're exceptions to every rule. [1st
Ave Machine](http://1stavemachine.com) is a CG animation/postproduction house in
NYC, doing some very slick projects mixing (semi)generative 3d and real world
footage to blur the line between "what we perceive as real and impossible".
Mutated botanics, weird worm-like creatures, glossy urchins, near perfect light
matching, shaky cam, added film grain - the works. It's a model citizen of
[Uncanny Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley). A very inspiring
one, I think...

Now if only that'd be interactive, some of the creatures would make some cute
[cyber pets](http://www.rspca.org.uk/cyberpet) ;)
