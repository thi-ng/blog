# Processing in Eclipse

Started writing a step-by-step tutorial for integrating the
[Processing](https://processing.org) libraries for use in
[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). There's also an [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) build file to export
your projects as applets. Note: there seem to be a few issues with this for all
you OSX peeps out there, but I would appreciate if you give it a go anyway and
let me know your problems. Will post updates as the become available.

Tutorial is [over here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061003185049/http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Integrate;action=display;num=1106256315;start=0)...
