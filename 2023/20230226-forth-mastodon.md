# Forth on Mastodon

Its such a joy to watch! Don't know if it has more to do with moving to Mastodon
and following a quite different crowd of people, but even before that, for the
past few years I started sensing a (re)growing interest in #Forth-style
languages and related philosophies, i.e. low fat, low energy, minimalism,
self-sufficiency, interactive programming, dynamic systems, DSLs, VMs, emulation
etc. Renewed interest in all this also seems to come from people with vastly
different backgrounds & ages. Forth being one of the most underappreciated langs
ever, 10 years ago it felt (subjective experience, no proof!) most active
Forthers were either a) #RetroComputing people who've been using the language
for decades and/or b) people working w/ severely resource constrained embedded
devices (often an overlap). These groups still exist ofc, but I wouldn't be very
surprised to learn if demographics taking an active interest (above and beyond
doing some toy examples) have started shifting noticeably.

Back in 2015, the ForthHub org on GitHub had a dozen or so members, today its
~240. /r/Forth also has 3k members now, which isn't too shabby (even though a
mere blip in the greater picture, but still...)

Is some of this due to more people getting fed up with heaviness of existing
mainstream langs & tooling, looking for lighter alternatives? I don't know.
Maybe more people are finding their way to functional programming (incl. getting
pre-exposed to REPLs and their life-changing impact/discovery of interactive dev
processes) and from there taking the smaller step to explore
concatenative/stack-based langs...? 🤷‍♂️

Enough hypothesizing — it's just all _very_ exciting to watch how this is
developing and hopefully new ideas & learnings from other langs/envs finding
their way into Forth-lands!

Ps. Now go check out @ratfactor@mastodon.art's great talk/summary/history on the
matter:

Ps2. Shameless plug, if you want to try out a Forth in the browser, check out my
VM/REPL (incl. screen casts, Forth shaders/webaudio examples):
