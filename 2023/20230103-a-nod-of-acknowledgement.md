# A simple nod of acknowledgment

Most opensource projects are (still) created and maintained by individuals &
small groups of volunteers, not by Big Techâ„¢. Project owners are usually
_thrilled & excited_ to learn how people are using their libraries (I know I
am!), also to learn how/where to improve them. Yet, how is it still so much to
ask of people to even just publicly mention/acknowledge that an OS
project/library was instrumental to their own creations? Even if (some) licenses
don't explicitly require this, so many users of OS code don't ever seem to see
the social & energy side of these shared goods. Sometimes not for years.

## Opensource != Consumerism

Without even these minute, literally zero-cost feedback cycles (really just
talking about gestures here!) it can be a very unthankful, sometimes plain
frustrating, not to mention unfair and unsustainable, experience for creators of
said tools.

## Opensource == Mutual Aid

IMHO lacking any other form of support given, the minimum social imperative for
users is to at least somehow give a little nod/credit to those projects and
(indirectly) to the people behind them, those who're contributing their time,
experience & energy to help you (and others) along to achieve your own goals!
