# Sonia v2.5

[Amit Pitaru](https://pitaru.com/) just released the latest version of his audio
library
[Sonia](https://web.archive.org/web/20040209040307/http://www.pitaru.com/sonia/)
for use with Processing. Internally, Sonia is building on the
[JSyn](http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/) classes/plugin, which provide x-platform,
native access to the system's audio architecture and allow for low latency audio
applications, compared to the default Java API.
