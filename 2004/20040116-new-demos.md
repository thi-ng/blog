# New demos

Uploaded 2 older demos demonstrating different techniques:

[Cicular buffering](https://web.archive.org/web/20040311182746/http://www.toxi.co.uk/p5/cyclo/cycloBW.pde)

this demo uses 16 offscreen buffers which are used as subframes of a looping,
but constantly changing animation. The animation consist of 1 particle whose
position is interpolating to the current mouse position. Because the
screenbuffer is never cleared, the technique creates a growing number of moving
objects without an ever loss in performance or increase in cost of computing
those.

[Perlin noise realtime dithering](https://web.archive.org/web/20040815023131/http://toxi.co.uk/p5/perlin/dither/perlin_dither.pde)

a very simple pattern based dithering, based on the perlin noise function, is
used to translate a shaded image into a dithered black&white image. By adjusting
parameters of the noise function, the visual character can be varied between
using dots and stipes.
