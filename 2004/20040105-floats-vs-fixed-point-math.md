# Floats vs. fixed point math

Just posting links to a few older bits I wrote, which might be helpful to know
when you're trying to speed up your sketches. This one is about [using fixed
precision numbers instead of
floats](http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1068688302;#3).
Here's also more general [comparison of number types and different algebra
modes](http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1067898264;#5).
